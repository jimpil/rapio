# R(andom)A(ccess)P(arallel)IO


## What
A tiny library for doing parallel IO against local files in Clojure. It's all based on `java.io.RandomAccessFile`.

## Where
FIXME

## Usage
Only one namespace is required for typical usage:

### rapio.core

#### pslurp
A parallel version of `clojure.core/slurp`, which will work against a String, File \& URI/URL (referring to a local file), as long as it's smaller than 2GB. 
It can (optionally) return the raw bytes.
The level of parallelism is controlled via `:threads` and defaults to `(.availableProcessors (Runtime/getRuntime))`.


#### pslurp-big
Similar to `pslurp`, but intended to be used with files larger than 2GB. Always returns a sequence of byte-arrays.

##### Usage
```clj
(let [big-file  "/home/user/up-to-2GB.dat"
      huge-file "/home/user/up-to-8TB.dat"]
  
  ;; pslurp with 4 threads returning byte-array
  (pslurp big-file 
          :raw-bytes? true 
          :threads 4)  ;; => a byte-array
          
  ;; pslurp with all available cores returning (UTF-8) String
  (pslurp big-file)  ;; => a String
  
  (pslurp-big huge-file)  ;; => a seq of byte-arrays        
  )

```

#### pspit
A parallel version of `clojure.core/spit`, which will work against a String or byte-array content. Destination can be a String, File \& URI/URL (referring to a local file).

#### pspit-big
Similar to `pspit`, but intended to be used against multiple contents, whose concatenation wouldn't fit in a single String or byte-array (i.e. larger than 2GB).

##### Usage

```clj
(let [large-file "/home/.../.../.../update.zip" ;; 2.2GB
      arrays (pslurp-big large-file)
      lengths (map alength arrays)
      lengths-sum (apply + lengths)
      large-file-copy (str large-file "-DELETEME")]
    (try
      (pspit-big large-file-copy arrays)

      (and
        (= lengths-sum ;; didn't miss any bytes when pslurping-big
           (internal/local-file-size large-file))

        (= lengths-sum ;; didn't miss any bytes when pspiting-big
           (internal/local-file-size large-file-copy)))

      (finally
        (jio/delete-file large-file-copy)))
    ) 
 => true
```
